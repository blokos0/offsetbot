Post-processing variants are applied _during the placement of the tile on the grid_, meaning they apply after anything else. These are all manipulating either where or how the tile is placed. There are only two, being `:<blending>` and `:disp<x>/<y>`.
`:<blending>` sets an alternative blending mode for the tile to use. More information about these can be found in the variant description, or on [the Wikipedia page for blending modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend_modes).
`:displace<x>/<y>` displaces where the sprite will be put on the render, in pixels. This is extremely useful for making dioramas or scenes.
