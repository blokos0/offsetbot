Variants are a way of manipulating a tile. There are 3* kinds, applying in this order:

- Tile creation variants
- Sprite manipulation variants
- Postprocessing variants

The variant type is specified with the variant, along with a description, in the `variants` command. This lists every variant in the bot, but it can be narrowed with a regular expression.
